<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Professor Jeremy Bailenson once said that XR can be used in places that are either hazardous, or experiences that aren't available otherwise. The issue we are dealing with is the lack of proper training to deal with fire accidents that may accelerate to something bigger. People don't know the types of fires & fire extinguishers and hence are not able to respond to such situations properly.

With Meta's Presence platform, it is easy to train for hazardous situations in personal and safe spaces. Our solution aims at training users on how to respond to fire accidents that have the potential of growing bigger. We use passthrough API, hand tracking, voice commands and game learning to augment a fire situation, and the user has to make smart decisions in the given time period.

How it Works:
* Introduction - The Assistant Teaches you things
* Scenario Spawns - A scenario is Spawned Randomly in your Own Environment in Passthrough
* Scenario Analysis + Understanding - User uses their time to analyse the situation, time used is calculated for scores
* Scenario Response - User uses Hand Based Interactions to respond to the Scenario and Voice Based Commands to tell the Assistant what to use
* End - If the correct extinguisher type is selected using the correct voice command, the assistant puts out the fire. Otherwise, boom.
